DESCRIPTION 
    The Next Generation Attenuation (NGA) 2008 Ground Motion Prediction Equations
    This package could be extended to include more ground motion predition models and 
    include updated NGA models 

COMPONENTS
    0. combination of all NGA models 
       __init__.py 
	   It can deal with periods that are not in the existing period list (interpolation)
	   default period list (Different models have different list): 
	    'BA': [0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.05, 0.075, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, 0.25,
		  0.30, 0.40, 0.50, 0.75, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 7.5, 10.0,-1,-2],   # last two: PGA, PGV, 
	    'CB': [0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.05, 0.075, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, 0.25,
		  0.30, 0.40, 0.50, 0.75, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 7.5, 10.0,-1,-2],    
	    'CY': [0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05, 0.075, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, 0.25,
		  0.30, 0.40, 0.50, 0.75, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 7.5, 10.0,-1,-2],    
	    'AS': [0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05, 0.075, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, 0.25,
		  0.30, 0.40, 0.50, 0.75, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 7.5, 10.0,-1,-2], 

    1. Four NGA models (details)
       AS08.py, BA08.py, CB08.py, CY08.py 
	   Basic required inputs: 
	       T    : Period  
	       Mw   : Magnitude 
	       Rjb  : Joyer-Boore distance Rjb 
	       rake : This could be None, but then you have specify the fault type (Ftype) as following: 
		      'U': Unknown (just for BA08 model)
		      'SS': Strike-slip
		      'RV': Reverse 
		      'NM': Normal 
		      the relationship between rake and fault type could be found in ./utils.py 
	       Vs30 : average S wave velocity of upper 30m 
	       Fhw  : This could be None, but then you have to specify Rx or azimuth (Source to Site azimuth) 
		      the definition of azimuth can be found in James et al. (2011) BSSA paper 
          Optional inputs: 
               # Check __init__.py
               

    2. Spudich and Chiou 2008 directivity model (under-construction)
       SC08.py 
	   right now, it requires inputs generated from Matlab package (Spudich and Chiou 2008)
           The self-generated inputs would be available soon...
    
    3. NGA dataset (xls format) manipulation 
       NGAdataset.py 
    
    4. NGA dataset (original datafiles used for regression to obtain the NGA models)
       ./NGAdata/NGA_Flatfile.xls 
    
    5. Validation of pynga
       ./Validation, the pynga is validated with OpenSHA (discussion with Christine), and the distance calculation
       utilities are validated with OpenSHA
       ./Validation/plots/ValidationNGAs/ show the NGA calculation comparison results (within 0.02% for PGA and SA at various periods)
       ./Validation/plots/ValidationDistances/ show the distance calculation comparison (within 1km)
  
    6. Applications of pynga in Fling Study (basis for broadband application of pynga)
       ./FlingStudy (similar to BBP, src read, distance calculation and GMPEs results)
       ./BBP ( simple workflow for BBP Part B GMPE comparisons with simulation results ) 


DOWNLOAD 
    Since the package is version-controlled on GitHub, so you can clone the package using "git clone" 
	git clone git@github.com:fengw/pynga.git 
    or go to "https://github.com/fengw/pynga" to download a tar version of the package


INSTALLATION
    1. Pre-Install (dependences):
	Basis python (2.5 or higher version) + numpy  (required by compute NGA results)
          Optional: matplotlib (Debug to visually check validation and calculated results)
                    pyproj     ( used to compute unknown distance parameters for inputs in NGA models)
                    xlrd, xlwt ( used in NGA flatfile manipulation tools )

    2. ADD to PYTHONPATH (on MacOS and Linux)
        Method1: Assuming you download the package in ${PathToSaveThePackage}
	vi .bashrc (assuming you use bash, similar to other shells) in the home directory
	   first, set up your PYTHONHOME (where you installed your python)
	   second, set up the PYTHONPATH, usually, it equals to 
	       export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONHOME}/lib/python{version}/site_packages
	   third, add the package downloaded into the PYTHONPATH by 
	      export PYTHONPATH=$HOME/local/pynga:$PYTHONPATH

UPDATES
    I might change the code very often for my research purposes, but you can keep updating your version of pynga with mine
    by using: 
       git pull 
    in the pynga directory 
   
    If you find any bugs in the code, let me know, and my email address is: fengo.win@gmail.com

USAGE
    Launch python or ipython, type: import pynga
    In you script: 
	from pynga import *      # import all NGA models
	from pynga.utils import *    # import utils that will be used in the process
        
        # set inputs parameters: 
        model_name = 'BA'; period = 3.0; Mw = 7.0; Rjb = 10.; Vs30 = 760.; Ftype='SS', \
        
        # The settings from those keywords, please refer to __init__.py 
        median, sigmaT, tau, sigma = NGA08( model_name, Mw, Rjb, Vs30, period, epislon=0, Ftype=Ftype)
        The unit of median, sigmaT, tau and sigma are all in (g)
